# libugomemo
libugomemo is a WIP Flipnote Studio (3D) file parsing library made in C++. The goal of this library is to have an implementation of every major function for processing .kwz and .ppm files, including metadata, audio, and video processing.

Currently this repository is just a collection of static functions, but once all functionality is written out it will be turned in to a library with a convenient object oriented frontend.
