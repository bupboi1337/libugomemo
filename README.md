# Progress

- ‚úÖ File metadata extraction
- ‚úÖ Thumbnail extraction
- üü© Frame decoding - rough skeleton implemented
- üü© Audio track decoding - rough skeleton implemented
- ‚ùå Converting author names from UTF-16 to readable encoding\
- ‚ùå Conversion of timestamps (to unix epoch? to formatted date/time?)
- ‚ùå Frame output to file
- ‚ùå Audio track output to file
- ‚ùå Audio track mixing with sound effects from frame meta
- ‚ùå Conversion of entire flipnote to (mp4) file
- ‚ùå Handling all DSi Library conversion inconsistencies

# Observed DSi Library Conversion Errors

- Parent file name is sometimes in the ppm format
- DSi Library folder structure uses the Flipnote Studio FSID format to sort by author IDs
