# kwz-cpp
A work in progress Flipnote Studio 3D .kwz file processing program made in C++. Progress is actively updated below as work is done.

# Installation

Edit the `input_file_path` string in `main()` in `kwz.cpp` to specify your input file (remember to escape back slashes if on windows!) to process then compile with Visual Studio 2019, GCC, etc. and run.

# Progress

- ‚úÖ File metadata extraction
- ‚úÖ Thumbnail extraction - fully implemented
- ‚úÖ Audio track decoding - fully implemented wav file output
- üü© Frame decoding - rough skeleton implemented
- ‚ùå Conversion of timestamps (to unix epoch? to formatted date/time?) currently outputs the raw timestamp, the number of seconds from 00:00:00 1/1/2000.
- ‚ùå Converting author names from UTF-16 to readable encoding
- ‚ùå Frame output to file
- ‚ùå Audio track output to file
- ‚ùå Audio track mixing with sound effects from frame meta
- ‚ùå Conversion of entire flipnote to mp4 file
- ‚ùå Handling all DSi Library conversion inconsistencies
- ‚ùå Running from CLI implementation
- ‚ùå Replace expensive for loops with individually setting values

# Observed issues with the .kwz format

- Parent file name is sometimes in the ppm format for DSi Library notes
- The DSi Library S3 bucket folder structure uses the Flipnote Studio FSID format to sort by author IDs
- Thumbnails are officially extracted with 3 unknown bytes at the end of the file, after the `0xD9` byte that terminates the JPG file normally.
- Audio decoding issues resulting in corrupt-sounding audio in DSi Library flipnotes.
- In some Flipnote Gallery World notes, the thumbnail JPG data appears to be corrupted. This has not been observed in DSi Library flipnotes.
