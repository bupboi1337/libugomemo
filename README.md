# libugomemo
libugomemo is a work in progress Flipnote Studio 3D .kwz file parsing library made in C++. The goal of this library is to have an implementation of every major function for processing .kwz files (metadata, audio, and video processing).

Currently this repository just contains a bunch of files with static functions. Once all functionality is written out, this will be turned in to a library with an object oriented interface.
